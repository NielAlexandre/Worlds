A junkpunk world would be a dystopian future where resources are scarce and technology is cobbled together from scraps. The landscape would be littered with abandoned factories and rusted machinery, and the air would be thick with pollution. The people would be resourceful and inventive, using discarded materials to create new tools and machines. They would live in makeshift shelters made from salvaged materials, and they would scavenge for food and water.

The junkpunk aesthetic is often characterized by a gritty, industrial look, with exposed metalwork, pipes, and wires. Clothing would be made from scraps of fabric and leather, and accessories would often be repurposed from found objects. The overall impression would be one of improvisation and resourcefulness.
